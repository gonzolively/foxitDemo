# Example PDFs

This folder contains **pre-generated PDF samples** for the HR onboarding demo.

- Each file is the output of running the Foxit DocGen step for one of the templates (confidentiality agreement, employee handbook, IT security policy) using sample employee data.
- These PDFs are **not signed** and have not been through the Foxit eSign flow; they are provided only so you can quickly see what the filled documents look like without running the demo.

To generate fresh PDFs (and optionally send them for signing), use the main app UI and the templates under `templates/` with the employee data under `employee_data/`.
